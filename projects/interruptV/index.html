          <h1>About Interrupt</h1>

          <p>Celebrating the intersection of writing and new media, Interrupt V will involve readings, exhibitions, performances and video screenings, along with discussions that investigate "interruption" in digital language art and performance. In computing, an interrupt is a command sent to the central processor, demanding its attention and calling for the initiation of a new task. The festival’s aim is to not only interrupt trends in the field of literary theory and digital aesthetics, but practice interruption as an applied critique of systemic forces.</p>

          <p>The festival’s approach to media and authorship casts light on the myriad ways data encrypts the body in late capitalism. As computational media becomes increasingly material, and media is ever more woven into sensation, this conference considers digital writing as an impression on the body. By highlighting performance and new media artists who have used their own bodies as aesthetic tools, and writers who describe embodiment, Interrupt V focuses on the biological as a system of networks. Electronics and computational vernaculars are not outside of the ecological. The notion that meditated text art exists without natural resources, material processing systems, and very human pathologies must be interrupted!</p>

           <h1>Participants</h1>

           <p><strong>Abraham Avnisan</strong>  is an interdisciplinary artist, writer and educator whose work is situated at the intersection of image, text, and code. He creates artists' books, applications for mobile devices, new media installations and mixed reality performances that seek to subvert dominant narratives through embodied encounters with language, history, and philosophy. Abraham is the recipient of a Digital Studies Fellowship through Rutgers University—Camden, a Digital Humanities Summer Fellowship through the Simpson Center for the Humanities, and the Rosen and Edes Foundation Semi-Finalist Fellowship for Emerging Artists. He teaches creative writing, new media art and interactive media design as an Artist-in-Residence in the School of Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences at University of Washington Bothell.
           </p>

           <p>Iraqi-born artist <strong>Wafaa Bilal</strong> is an Associate Arts Professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and  known internationally for his online performative and interactive works provoking dialogue about international politics and internal dynamics. For his 2007 installation, Domestic Tension, Bilal spent a month in a Chicago gallery with a paintball gun that people could shoot at him over the Internet. The Chicago Tribune called it “one of the sharpest works of political art to be seen in a long time” and named him 2008 Artist of the Year. Bilal’s work is constantly informed by the experience of fleeing his homeland and existing simultaneously in two worlds – his home in the “comfort zone” of the U.S. and his consciousness of the “conflict zone” in Iraq. Using his own body as a medium, Bilal continued to challenge our comfort zone with projects like 3rdi and …and Counting. Bilal’s most recent body of work, Canto III, premiered in a solo booth at the New York Armory Show in 2015 and went on to be shown in the 2015 Venice Biennale. In 2008 City Lights published “Shoot an Iraqi: Art, Life and Resistance Under the Gun,” about Bilal’s life and the Domestic Tension project. He holds a BFA from the University of New Mexico and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, IL; MATHAF: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha, Qatar; amongst others.
